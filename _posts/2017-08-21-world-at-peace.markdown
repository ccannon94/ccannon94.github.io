Today, portions of the United States will be able to view a full solar eclipse for the first time in 38 years.
As an engineer, a student of applied science, I am very excited to see this remarkable and rare natural phenomenon.
As a Christian, I am floored by the reminder that God created this remarkable universe for us to live in, to reflect His glory.

> "what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
> human beings that you care for them? When I consider your heavens,
> the work of your fingers,
> the moon and the stars,
> which you have set in place, LORD, our Lord,
> how majestic is your name in all the earth!
> You have set your glory
> in the heavens."
> Psalm 8:1,3-4 New International Version

Frank Reynolds, anchor for ABC News, covered the last such occurrence on February 26, 1979.
As he closed his broadcast, 38 years ago, he shared a magnificent quote with his audience.

I sincerely miss this level of national dialogue. Today, I imagine such news casts will end with some lame, thinly veiled attack
at the "other side", said side depending on which channel you're watching. Aspirational thinking has been replaced with
disparaging rhetoric, striving for unity replaced with fighting for dominance. There are _obvious_, _disgusting_ examples of this
divisiveness in white nationalists yearning, either by marching in Charlottesville or in the hidden desires of their hearts,
to subjugate other individuals because they don't fit their reprehensible ideal of racial superiority. There are examples in the
calculated, cold-blooded murders of police officers in Dallas and other cities, individuals who have no direct link to the murderer's
warped grievance. There is an example in the attack on congressmen on practicing baseball in a D.C. suburb one early morning. There is
evidence where people are killed by police when other options for de-escalation exist.
