So... let's talk hackathons! Hackathons are events that present a problem to a group of computer programmers, designers, and other interested individuals, give those
individuals a short timeline (usually 12-48 hours) to create a solution to that problem, and judge the solutions to select the best! This past weekend I participated
in my very first hackathon, [HackathonCLT](www.hackathonCLT.org). This event is hosted by [Tresata](http://www.tresata.com), a data intelligence firm in Charlotte,
[Harris Teeter](htpp://www.harristeeter.com), and several other great [sponsors](http://hackathonclt.org/sponsors-partners/). [Discovery Place](https://www.discoveryplace.org) provided a fun and
unique atmosphere for this year's event.
