So... let's talk hackathons! Hackathons are events that present a problem to a group of computer programmers, designers, and other interested individuals, give those
individuals a short timeline (usually 12-48 hours) to create a solution to that problem, and judge the solutions to select the best! This past weekend I participated
in my very first hackathon, [HackathonCLT](www.hackathonCLT.org). This event is hosted by [Tresata](http://www.tresata.com), a data intelligence firm in Charlotte,
[Harris Teeter](htpp://www.harristeeter.com), and several other great [sponsors](http://hackathonclt.org/sponsors-partners/). [Discovery Place](https://www.science.discoveryplace.org)
provided a fun and unique atmosphere for this year's event.

Now, when a hackathon talks about "hacking", it doesn't necessarily mean the cunning cybercriminals and white-hat security analysts engaged in breaking into computer systems. Instead,
this "hacking" refers to utilizing the computing resources we have before us to solve problems in new, innovative way. This form of "hacking" is the subject of Steven Levy's
[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php/books/hackers), which follows the original computer scientists and engineers who dared used the computers
of their day to solve the problems they saw. So that's what we are all about, taking the computer science we know, and applying it to real problems in new ways.

I participated in this hackathon with other students from my school's [chapter](http://csacm.ncat.edu) of [ACM](http://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization). Teams could be
anywhere from 1-3 people, and for those who do not have a team there was a brief "mixer" period before the problem presentation to find others and form a team.

Here's a few of us before the event, I'm on the left.

### The Problem
Every year, HackathonCLT benefits a nonprofit organization that is active in the community. This year, we were to benefit [Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Charlotte](http://bbbscharlotte.org).
The objectives were divided into three categories, giving participants of varying skill sets an opportunity to be competitive! For $10,000, teams in the _Hack_ category worked to analyze the data
that BBBS had on hand to develop a better system of matching "bigs" with "littles". The $5,000 _Code_ category required developing some piece of software that would make finding new "bigs" easier by simplifying the application process. Finally, the $2,000 _Freestyle_ category allowed participants to come up with any pitch to help BBBS accomplish their goals better. This problem was presented in an approximately 30 minute presentation, which concluded with a surprise performance by members of [Opera Charlotte](https://www.operacarolina.org)! Nothing quite like hacking a hackathon, huh?

### RELEASE THE CODERS
After the problem presentation concluded, it was time to release the coders! Everyone scrambled to find a space to work and get coding! Now, Discovery Place is a top-notch venue for nerds, but
one thing that lacked was appropriate work spaces with access to power! As you can imagine, coding for 12 hours straight definitely required plentiful power supply. Luckily, my group managed to find a nice table in the "Explore More Collections" exhibition that usually help digital microscopes and monitors!

Then became a several hour long process of figuring out what exactly we were equipped to do, and a failed attempt on my behalf to master TensorFlow in 2 hours, we decided to go with the _Code_ level. We worked hard until the wee hours of the morning. Pizza was available every few hours, and drinks were provided at no charge. There were a few events planned throughout the evening, but
rather than partake my team stayed at our table (mostly) hard at work.

After breakfast, "pre-judging" began at around 7am and lasted until 9am. My group cut it just a bit close at 8:40, but hey, we needed to extra time. The pre-judging consisted of a 3 minute pitch to two judges, including technical and business experts. The experts gave quick pointers and feedback after the pre-judging, and we went back to work preparing our product and presentation for
the finals. This is when things got interesting, as the museum opened to the public and our workspace was flooded with curious parents and children. However, we were able to quickly but thoroughly answer most questions (mostly about why we weren't trying to break into anything or steal any data in our "hackathon") and still get our work done!

### The Finals

At 12 pm, the whole group met in the Discovery Place auditorium, where Tresata's CEO and HackathonCLT's founder Abhishek Mehta MC'ed the final meeting. Here, finalists where announced one at a time and teams were allowed 5 minutes to present their solution to a panel of four judges, Tresata's Mehta, Dr. Tim Chartier of Davidson College, CEO of BBBS of Greater Charlotte Donna Dunlap, and Keva Walton of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. A nerve wracking, but exciting experience, my group chose to go with a more concise, targeted pitch than many of our competitors, with a
couple of jokes and a personal reason as to why our solution mattered. 3 teams from each category were selected to present in the finals, and 1 wildcard team which could come from any category.
UNCC Charlotte's ACM Team was selected as this year's wildcard team from the _Hack_ category.

North Carolina A&T was well represented in the finals, with my teams from the _Code_ category and another great idea from the _Freestyle_ team selected to present. And apparently our strategy
paid off, as my team was selected as the winner of the _Code_ category. Here's my selfie with the big check!

I know I know, but I had to, okay?

### Takeaway

Hackathon's are exciting events! Hackathon's are also _exhausting_! But I feel like I learned more as a developer in the last 24 hours than I did since the end of my last internship, and I'm
grateful for it! Honestly, winning helped a lot. But I think that should be a lesson that just because you're a student or new to hackathons doesn't mean you can't bring home to top prizes!
In the case of HackathonCLT, our solutions were presented to a great organization that can make real use of what we did. Some hackathons take on hypothetical problems or "thought exercises",
and it was a very cool thing to work on a **real** problem for a real organization that really helps my community, and I definitely commend HackathonCLT for that. So, if you're a developer,
designer, or a creative person in any way (the _freestyle_ category did not require any code), check out some sites like [Hackathon.io](http://www.hackathon.io) or [HackEvents](http://www.hackevents.co) and find a hackathon near you!
