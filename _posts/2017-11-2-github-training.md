  Chris recently published the first several modules of an open GitHub training curriculum through the Aggie Makerspace at North Carolina A&T State University. The training is openly accessible to anyone, and is primarily geared towards moving NC A&T Students from having no knowledge of version control to mastering advanced git and GitHub topics. The github-training repository is publicly hosted on [the makerspace GitHub](https://github.com/aggiemakerspace/github-training).
