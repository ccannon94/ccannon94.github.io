Hello world welcome to my blog! My name is Chris and I am a computer engineering student at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University
in Greensboro, North Carolina! I am an avid programmer and I work as a Teaching Assistant in my school's Computer Science Department in the College of
Engineering! The purpose of this blog will be for me to have an outlet for all of my thoughts, things I learn, and experiences I have as I learn more and
more every day. I hope you enjoy, and learn something with me.
