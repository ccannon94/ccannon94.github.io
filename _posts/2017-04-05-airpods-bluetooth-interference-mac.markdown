I recently received a pair of AirPods as a birthday present and I must say, they are incredible. However, I experienced some difficulty right away with connecting them to my Mac Mini. They would pair, but sound would come over broken, jumping from one ear to the other, with nothing clear coming through. I decided to contact Apple Support after trying the most basic troubleshooting I could think of; unpairing and repairing the AirPods from my AppleID, and pairing the AirPods directly to the Mac Mini. 

### The Solution
Basically, after 4 different case numbers, we determined that the most likely cause of my issue was an abundance of Bluetooth interference from my previous generation Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse. The final Apple Support advisor I spoke with suggested that I power off my keyboard and trackpad, using only the mouse to pair the AirPods. Once I did, music came in consistently clear like it hadn't before.
