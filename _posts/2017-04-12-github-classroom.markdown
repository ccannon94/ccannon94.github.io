This past summer and fall, I completed my first internship as a computer engineering student. Honestly, I was amazed when I finally got to work on the code base and was introduced to this crazy command line application called "git". Suddenly, thanks to git and a solid online repository hosting service, almost every annoyance I with storing and organizing code was eliminated! I was absolutely appalled that this was something I had _never_ been taught as a student software developer.
