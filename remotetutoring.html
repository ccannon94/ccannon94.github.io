  <h1>Remote Tutoring</h1>
  <h4>Before joining remote tutoring, you must install <a href="https://atom.io">the Atom text editor</a>, and then the <a href="https://teletype.atom.io">teletype package</a></h4>
  <h4>Open Teletype by clicking the Teletype logo as shown. Follow the brief instructions to finish configuring Teletype.</h4>

  <h3>Requesting a remote tutoring appointment<h2>
  <p>Go to <a href="https://doodle.com/chriscannon">Chris's Doodle calender</a> to request a remote tutoring session. Availablility is subject to change, so it is best that you choose several possible times in your request. You may not request a session longer than 30 min. You will receive an email back within 24 hours confirming your request or suggesting a better time.</p>
  
  <h3>Attending your remote tutoring appointment</h2>
  <p>Tutoring will take place in <a href="https://zoom.us/j/3744494646">Chris's Zoom meeting room.</a></p>
  <p>Remote tutoring is not "pair programming". You must have some questions prepared before the tutoring session, and when your questions have all been answered, the tutoring session will end. This is not a time to program with Chris at your disposal.</p>
